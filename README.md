# AssociatedArtistCrawler
Works with Python 2.

This crawler crawls associated artists and band members from Wikipedia articles of bands. 

To initialize the stack file has to be filled with the starting article and one empty line. done and output should be empty.

The program can be stopped by pressing CTRL+C at any time and will later resume at the last crawled article.

To further process the output the output file has to be sorted and processed by uniq.

The output file is separated by tabs. The graph is directionless, the order of the artists in the edge output file is alphabetically ordered.
